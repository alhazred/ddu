# OpenSolaris Device Driver Utility v.1.2

Device Driver Utility provides information about the devices of your native system having OpenSolarisTM Operating System (OS) installed. Device Driver Utility enables you to connect to the Image Packaging System (IPS) to search for the device drivers for the devices that do not have a driver attached with it. IPS is a repository for OpenSolaris packages where you can find suitable drivers for the devices. By using the Device Driver Utility application, you can do the following:

* Get the information of the devices installed on your native system and their corresponding device driver availability status.

* Check the device driver availability for your system devices on IPS.

* Download and install the device drivers from IPS for those devices on your system that do not have an attached driver.

* Report system configurations to the OpenSolaris community.
